# Legacy DBF structure

The legacy database schema was split across several DBF files:

* `regconfi.dbf` - convention configuration and properties
* `classes.dbf` - the types of memberships/badges
* `members.dbf` - member entries for the convention
* `master.dbf` - master database of all/previous convention members
